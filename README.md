This codebase was not fully similar with the tutorial. Some of modifications has been added for author's learning purpose.

## Initialization Step

1. Initialize dependencies library by: `npm init -y` to make prompt answer to "yes".
2. Installing npm packages require for this tutorial (`express`, `body-parser` and `mongodb`) by type: `npm install express body-parser mongodb`.

## Installing & Run MongoDB Server Locally (Windows)

1. Visit the official MongoDB website [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition for Windows.
2. Choose the MSI package for Windows and follow the installation instructions.
3. Run the downloaded MSI installer. Choose "Complete" as the setup type to install all necessary components. Follow the installation wizard, and make sure to select the option to install MongoDB as a service. This will ensure that the MongoDB server starts automatically when your PC boots up.
